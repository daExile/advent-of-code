# Advent of Code - the road to { 50 * years } stars

Might contain trace amounts of decent code (but no promises).

I'm mostly doing it for fun and learning / improving my code, while at it (now learning to work with gitstuff, too).

Probably a lot of it is various degree of terrible at this point, especially earlier Python solutions to more complex puzzles. Doing cellular automata using dictionaries works, but isn't fast by any means. Some other problems were simply bruteforced :)

Intended to be reworked / fixed that one day, the goal is to code it in a way that "completes in 15 seconds".

Note: some puzzle part 1 / 2 outputs might depend on a switch variable, or be missing for now. This also to be fixed, for now all I did to old code is to replace hardcoded one-liner puzzle inputs with stdin.
