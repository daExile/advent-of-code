# Advent of Code
## Hobby coder's journey to all stars { :star: : 300/450 }
Might contain trace amounts of decent code (no promises).

Mostly done for fun and learning, so-o probably a lot of it is various degree of terrible and non-idiomatic. Especially earlier Python solutions (expect some silly bruteforce and cellular automata done using dictionaries). It should work, however, and stands a chance to be improved :)

## on "Rules"
- One source file per puzzle day, giving both parts' answers (not counting custom utility functions or recurring code moved to separate modules). Yeah, some Python code doesn't comply, yet (might have a switch variable or need hacking part 1 back in, but hey, it needs overall refresh).
- Only standard package libraries for a given language are used.
- No automated input downloads set up, toss the "good ol" text files with two-digit day number name `DD.txt` into the `__in` folder (or source folder for Python years I haven't updated yet. Sorreh).
- No serious input validity checks either, it works under assumption that a legit puzzle input is provided. Sometimes, there are more assumptions made about data structure of said input (that I would patch if I get to know that it causes certain valid inputs to explode).
